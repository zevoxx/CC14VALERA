  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I am a second-year ERP student specializing in SAP, with a strong interest in enterprise systems, 
      business process analysis, and ERP solution development. I am currently building a solid foundation 
      in both technical programming and business-oriented ERP concepts, enabling me to understand 
      how information systems support organizational processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic training includes hands-on exposure to SAP-related topics, ERP business simulations, 
      and structured analytical problem-solving. I am passionate about continuous learning and aim to 
      pursue a career as an ERP Developer, ABAP Programmer, Analyst, or Functional Consultant. 
      With a strong analytical mindset and effective task prioritization skills, I strive to deliver efficient 
      and well-structured solutions in both academic and professional environments.
